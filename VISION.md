# Vision: FS25_CustomTriggerCreator

> Ecosystem role: **World and NPCs** · Part of the Realistic Farming connected suite
> Status: TEMPLATE (complete after the ecosystem audit/baseline). Blanks are not decisions.
> Last updated: _fill on first edit_

This is a scaffold. It is intentionally empty so that after Arissani's ecosystem
audit/baseline we can fill it in without missing anything. Do not delete sections;
fill them or mark them "N/A" with a one-line reason.

## 1. One-line purpose
_What is this mod, in a single sentence a player would understand? Fill after audit._

## 2. Problem it solves
_The gameplay or realism gap this mod exists to close._

## 3. Design pillars
_Three to five non-negotiable principles that guide every feature decision._
- _pillar 1_
- _pillar 2_
- _pillar 3_

## 4. Role in the ecosystem
_How this mod fits the connected suite: what it depends on, what depends on it._
- Public handle on `g_currentMission.???`: _confirm from source during audit_
- Reads from (peer mods this consumes): _..._
- Read by (peer mods / FarmTablet apps that consume this): _..._
- Core-API registration status:
  - StateLedger (save/load): _yes/no + module name_
  - NetworkSync (MP state): _yes/no + channel_
  - MasterHUD (overlays): _yes/no_
  - SettingsHub (admin settings): _yes/no_

## 5. Explicit non-goals
_What this mod will deliberately NOT do (scope guardrails)._
- _non-goal 1_
- _non-goal 2_

## 6. Success criteria
_How we know the vision is being met (player-facing and technical)._

## 7. Open questions for the audit
_Things we want Arissani's audit/baseline to settle._
